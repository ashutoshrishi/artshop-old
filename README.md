# Art Shop

Art Shop was an old side project of mine to build a service enabling casual
artists at home to sell their framed canvas paintings online. This idea was
inspired by my Mother, who has done more canvas oil paintings than the pegs on
the walls of her house. Thus the app was focused on local hobbyist painters in
Indian cities in collaboration with a friend. Unfortunately the whole project
didn't build up to fruition due to various reasons. 

Moreover, this app was an experiment in Meteor + Blaze (back on meteor version
1.2.1. Maybe it's time to refocus the idea on a different tech stack or the
newer Meteor with ES6 and React.


## Building

Since this is a *MeteorJS* project, with `meteor` installed:

    meteor


Disclaimer: This was really built with Meteor version 1.2.1, the app will be
updated to use something more modern soon.
